# OER_stat
Notes on an OER stat course.

### Goals

This course will attempt to meet the following criteria:

1.  Serve as a prerequisite for the John Jay course STA 250
1.  Teach topics that largely agree with the topics taught in Statistics 150 at BMCC
1.  Expose students to a significant amount of coding


### Proprietary books:
These books contain information used in existing closed resource classes.  They are included because we want new OER resources which imitate them in some ways.

1. _Essentials of Statistics_ by Mario F. Triola  (Used in [Statistics 150 at BMCC](https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/distance/upload/MAT150-982.pdf)) [TOC available here](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Statistics-5th-Mario-Triola/dp/0321924592)
